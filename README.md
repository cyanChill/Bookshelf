## What I've Learned:

- Utilizing the "sticky" value for "position" to keep the navbar at the top of the screen
- Utilize absolute & relative positioning along with opacity to display a book form on screen when the user click the "Add New Book" button and hides the form if the user submits or clicks away from the form
- Learned how to store and retrieve arrays of objects in LocalStorage using JSON
- Improving my transition styling
