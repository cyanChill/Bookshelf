## Features

- Adding/Editing/Deleting Books to you bookshelf
- Searching books in your bookshelf
- Sorting books by insertion date or title
- Filter book by read status
- Light/Dark mode

## What I've Learned:

- Utilizing the "sticky" value for "position" to keep the navbar at the top of the screen
- Utilize absolute & relative positioning along with opacity to display a book form on screen when the user click the "Add New Book" button and hides the form if the user submits or clicks away from the form
- Utilized dataset to help with detection if the user has clicked outside the form to hide it
- Learned how to store and retrieve arrays of objects in LocalStorage using JSON
- Improving transition & animation styling abilities
- Utilized CSS variables to make a simple dark mode
